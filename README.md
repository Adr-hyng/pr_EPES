# ðŸš§ Project EPES ðŸš§ 
 
An open-source water dispenser using Raspberry Pi / Orange Pi utilizing Edge-AI technology for resource-constrained devices. *(Code, Circuit Design and Casing Design will be remodeled soon, project deadline on July 2025, Personal Gathered and Curated Image Dataset will be provided also)*. See early prototypes [here](Demo/) *(Still gathering images with [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/) and using proper curation with [FastDup](https://github.com/visual-layer/fastdup))*.

## Target Features:
- [ ] Automatic Dispensing - Automatically dispense upon container recognition as well as stop operation upon closely full of the said container.
- [ ] Compatibility with Orange Pi One
- [ ] Customizable and Hackable like Mugsy

## Raspberry Pi Setup
 
### Speaker On Boot *(Needs confirmation)*
 1. List available sound devices:
    ```bash
    aplay -l
    ```
    *(Identify the card number corresponding to the headphones for the speaker.)*
 2. Edit the ALSA configuration file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.asoundrc
    ```
 3. Add the following configuration (adjust the card number if necessary):
    ```bash
    pcm.!default {
        type hw
        card 2
    }
 
    ctl.!default {
        type hw
        card 2
    }
    ```
 
### Script on Boot *(Needs confirmation)*
 - *(Instructions for setting up a script to run on boot can be added here.)*
 
### Rebooting the Raspberry Pi
 ```bash
 sudo shutdown -r now
 ```
 
> **Note:** It is recommended to use Remote Desktop to the Raspberry Pi for easier debugging.
